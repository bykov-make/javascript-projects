## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project is self-contained and can be run independently:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to any project folder**
   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your browser**
    - No build process or dependencies required
    - Works in any modern web browser
